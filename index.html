    <p> <class="text">Aniya is a young lady who has many goals with many means to achieve them. As a 4th-year Information Technology Major at Florida A&M University, she is venturing to find the many avenues her degree can take her. Being a native from the District of Columbia, she has come a long way to make the next steps for her future.</p>
<p>Since attending FAMU, she has joined a few clubs such as the DMV(D.C., Maryland, and Virginia) Club, The Women Student Union, and the National Council of Negro Women. </p>
<p>She built work ethic, discipline, and team-building skills by working at various jobs, programs, and volunteer events from her high school years to now. Working at her middle school and assisting the IT department in fixing and distributing laptops allowed her to discover a part of what IT has to offer.</p>
<p>Besides working, Aniya allows herself to be involved in the community. Participating in church events, leading her non-profit organization Hats for Homeless, and setting an example for those younger than her, resulted in her being the 2018 recipient for the Youth of the Year Award at her church.  </p>
